# Datathlon Project: Car Accidents

Welcome to my Datathlon project, "Car Accidents"! This project was completed as part of the Professional Diploma in Data Analytics 
program offered by Deree the American College of Greece and Big Blue Data Academy. 

The Datathlon concept is a training program designed to simulate real-world data analytics scenarios. 
For this project, we were provided with a car accident dataset for Los Angeles, 
and our task was to analyze it and provide insights using different tools such as Python and Power BI. 

Our approach was to act as a small research team, 
working to identify potential solutions to a real-life problem faced by the state of California and the city of Los Angeles.

# Data Overview
The car accident dataset used in this project was provided by the progrm. It contained information on car accidents in Los Angeles from 2016 to 2021. 
We began our analysis by cleaning and pre-processing the data to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and ensure consistency in the data. 
This allowed us to perform more accurate analysis and provide insights that could be used to improve road safety in the city.

# Analysis Overview
In our analysis, we used a variety of data visualization tools, including Python and Power BI, to identify trends and patterns in a car accident dataset. 
Our focus was on identifying the relationships between the time of day, weather conditions, and severity of accidents.
We created several charts using Python, such as a count plot showing the relationship between severity and daylight/night,
a line plot illustrating the number of accidents per hour and month, and a clustered bar chart displaying the relationship between weather conditions and severity.
